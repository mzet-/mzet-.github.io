In the past, I found (already quite old - presented in 2013) slide deck [Burp Suite Pro real-life tips & tricks](https://www.agarri.fr/docs/HiP2k13-Burp_Pro_Tips_and_Tricks.pdf) authored by [Nicolas Gr√©goire](https://www.agarri.fr/en/index.html) very useful which gave me motivation to constantly look for effciencies in my day to day Burp Suite Pro usage. Since that time Burp has significantly evolved (major milestone - version 2.x was released) and lots of interesting 3rd party extensions were developed.

So I've decided to "borrow" the title from Nicolas and publish (as a reference for me and others) a few tips and tricks which I find useful during my web application penetration testing engagements. Will begin with testing for authorization/IDOR issues.

### Testing with AutoRepeater

There are bunch of Burp extensions for assisting in authorization testing but I find [AutoRepeater](https://github.com/nccgroup/AutoRepeater) by NCCGroup most convenient.

Let's consider typical web application that uses `Authorization: Bearer` token for request authentication purposes and it defines following types of users (i.e. permission levels):

1) administrator user
2) regular user
3) guest (unauthenticated) user

each user has other permission set and therefore can access other functionality and resources in the application. Site returns HTTP `401` in case of unauthorized access attempt.
